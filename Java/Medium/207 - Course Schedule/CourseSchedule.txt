Question
    There are a total of numCourses courses you have
    to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are
    given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]
    indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take
    course ai.

    For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you
    have to first take course 1.

    Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
