Question
    Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself
    (ie, symmetric around its center).

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will be implementing the iterative approach
        - In each of the iteration
            - we will be comparing the values of two nodes 'p' and 'q'
            - If both of the nodes are null
                - Then they are a valid pair
            - If one of the nodes is null
                - Then they are an invalid pair
            - If the nodes have the same value
                - Then they are a valid pair
            - If the nodes does not have the same value
                - Then they are an invalid pair
    - we can keep track of our nodes inside a 'queue'
        - In each of the iteration
            - We will poll 2 nodes out of queue for comparison
            - After comparing the 2 nodes
                - We will add the children of the nodes into the 'queue'

Answer
    - Lets validate the input parameter
        - If 'root' is equal to null
            - Return true
    - Create a 'queue' to keep track of our nodes
        - Add 'root' twice into 'queue'
    - While 'queue' is not empty
        - Poll two nodes 'p' and 'q' from 'queue'
        - If both of the nodes are null
            - continue to next iteration
        - If one of the nodes is null OR the nodes does not contain the same value
            - Return false
        - Add 'p.left' AND 'q.right' into 'queue'
        - Add 'p.right' AND 'q.left' into 'queue'
    - return true

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
        - O(n), visit each node once
    - Space Complexity = O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree
        - O(n), queue
