Question
    Given a non-empty array of decimal digits representing a non-negative
    integer, increment one to the integer.

    The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the
    head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

    You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except
    the number 0 itself.

    Constraints:
        - 1 <= digits.length <= 100
        - 0 <= digits[i] <= 9

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will be processing the numbers from right -> left
        - We will need to increment 1 to the last digit
    - There are two side cases we need to handle
        - When adding 1 to the last digit
            - There may be 'carry' over from the sum
                - Example: 19
                    - 20
                - This means we will need to keep track of the carry
                  in our addition
        - When adding 1 to the last digit
            - The output array may be longer than the input array
                - Example: 999
                    - The result will be 1000, which 1 digit more than the
                      length of the input array
            - This means we will need to keep track of our result inside
              a list first
                - Then we will convert the list to an array after

Answer
    - Create the following variables
        - result, linked list to keep track of the sum after adding 1 to
                   the input array
        - carry, the current carry, initially 1
    - Iterate through the indices from right -> left of 'digits', denoted as 'i'
        - Retrieve the digit 'd' from index 'i' from 'digits'
        - Find the 'sum'
            - sum = d + carry
        - If 'sum' is greater than 9
            - Set 'carry' to 1
        - Else
            - Set 'carry' to 0
        - Prepend 'sum % 10' to 'result'
            - The reason we are using modulus operation is because
              we want to get the ones place into our result
                - 19 -> 9
    - If 'carry' is greater than 0
        - Prepend 1 to 'result'
    - Return an array version of 'result'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(2 * n) = O(n), where n is the length of the input array
        - O(2 * n), visit each number once to find the sum, and then convert
          the 'result' list to an array
    - Space Complexity = O(2 * n) = O(n), where n is the length of the input array
        - O(2 * n), result list and array
